MACHINE LEARNING: Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
Machine Learning has been helping us in various applications such as customer service, healthcare, trading. With enormous amounts of good quality datasets, AI can predict the occurrence of numerous natural disasters, which can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people. Some of the natural disasters that can be predicted are :


EARTHQUAKE:

AI systems can be trained with the help of seismic data to analyze the magnitude and pattern of earthquakes and predict the location of earthquakes and aftershocks, thus saving millions of lives.


Floods:

The rainfalls in the previous years can be recorded and an application can be developed to simulate the floods.


Hurricanes:

Every year hurricanes cost property damage worth millions!. Data such as wind speed, rainfall, temperature, moisture can be recorded and can be used to predict the future occurrences of a hurricane.
Machine Learning can greatly help in emergency and disaster management efforts. If we can forecast the occurrence of a disaster, it will not only be helpful in saving thousands of lives but also mitigate the loss of money and infrastructure. Real-Time satellite images could be fed to the model which would lead to better response and relief to the impacted areas.
